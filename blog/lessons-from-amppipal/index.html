<h1>Lessons from Amppipal</h1>

<p><em>The front entrance to Amppipal Hospital</em></p>
<p>Already my time at the first hospital of our tests in Nepal has come to a close, and what an
experience it has been. Amppipal was vital in setting the stage for the rest of
this trip. It taught me about some of the realities of performing medical research in
developing countries, and I am better prepared for the challenges to come
because of the experiences I had there.</p>
<img src="/images/amppipal_hospital_with_mountains.JPG" alt="Amppipal Hospital" style="width: 100%;">
<p><em>Amppipal Hospital and the stunning view of the Himalayas</em></p>
<p>Amppipal is a small town north of Dumre, and its hospital is nestled in between
two hills facing the Annapurna mountain range. The hospital is separated from the main highway by a
45-minute bumpy jeep ride over unpaved mountain road, but the village around the
hospital is bursting with life. </p>
<h2 id="anything-that-can-go-wrong">Anything That Can Go Wrong...</h2>
<p>As is often the case while working in resource-constrained environments,
we began to encounter difficulties due to circumstances beyond our control. I
discovered the first big hurdle while unpacking: the FreePulse prototype was
damaged during our particularly bumpy ride!</p>

<p><em>Using a knife to reposition a pressure chip pad. Amazingly, it actually
worked.</em></p>
<p>During transit, the pressure sensor chip for the blood pressure circuit got
yanked off of its pads on the board. In order to take blood pressure
measurements at Amppipal, I would need to fix this chip before beginning
testing-- however, I had a very limited set of tools on hand to fix the sensor
chip in the right position (essentially just a knife and epoxy). Thankfully,
the director of the hospital was out of town for the day, moving our start day
back to Sunday. This gave me a large time window to make the fix, and so I
focused on repairing the device and getting everything up and running.</p>
<p>Sure enough, by the time Sunday came around I managed to tack down the NIBP chip using
a borrowed soldering iron and spare epoxy. We met the hospital director, Mr.
Baburam Giri, who very graciously gave approval for us to work in the
outpatient department starting that afternoon. However, after gathering our things and
preparing for the afternoon start time, I began to have an unsettling
feeling that grew to a full-out flu-like illness. I was completely
incapacitated by the time testing was supposed to begin, and so we (grudgingly)
pushed the start time to early the next morning.</p>

<p><em>We took precautions and wore facemasks and sanitized after every patient</em></p>
<p>Finally, I awoke the next morning feeling marginally better and ready for
action. Armed with facemasks and plenty of hand sanitizer, we set up a station
in the outpatient department and saw the first few patients of our trials in
Nepal! The nurses were incredibly helpful with communication as we
explained the purpose of the trial to each participant. When we broke for
lunch, we were on track to get ten patients recorded before the end of the day.</p>
<img src="/images/freepulse_test_lots_of_people.JPG" alt="Testing" style="width: 100%;">
<p><em>We performed some measurements outside in the OPD waiting area. The pulse ox
probe got accurate readings, even in the crazy ambient lighting!</em></p>
<p>After lunch, things seemed fairly quiet. After waiting in our testing room for a few
minutes, I wandered outside to ask one of the nurses if there were any
patients. Lo and behold, she informed me that there were no patients left in
the outpatient department, so they had closed for the day at 2 PM! The people
I had seen outside were simply villagers who were hanging out in the
outpatient waiting area!</p>

<p><em>Waiting in an empty room, pondering where all the patients went</em></p>
<p>All in all at Amppipal, we fixed one broken patient monitor, rode in over 1.5 hours
of unpaved road, overcame one flu-like illness, tested five patients, saw some 
incredible mountains, and met some truly incredible people.</p>

<p><em>Dr. Shrestha tried out FreePulse and gave great feedback about the device</em></p>
<h2 id="live-and-learn">Live and Learn</h2>
<p>Amppipal was an excellent learning experience, as a couple of key truths
about working in remote settings were reinforced to me. Firstly, it is critical
to always design redundantly so that even when the pressure sensor chip twists
off its pads (or any other range of improbable errors occur), the monitor keeps
working as expected. Built-in redundancy is the only line of defense that
exists when you are outside the reach of spare parts or sophisticated
electronics tools-- it's crucial to invest in making it strong during the
design phase.</p>
<p>Secondly, this redundancy should also apply to your experimental procedure and
scheduling. Especially in hospital settings, schedules are often at the mercy
of the availability of administrators and doctors, and preparing for this ahead
of time will save lots of headache and stress.</p>
<p>Thirdly, trust the staff! The nurses and doctors at these hospitals are skilled
and willing to help in everything from communication to taking somebody's blood
pressure, or serving as a helper during testing. I was astonished by the level
of generosity the staff at Amppipal showed us during our stay, and for that I am
extremely grateful.</p>

<p>We are now preparing for the second hospital of our tests: Okhaldhunga
Community Hospital. Armed with these experiences and lessons, I hope to make it
an even more exciting and productive time-- and I cannot wait to report on all
of the adventures we'll have!</p>
