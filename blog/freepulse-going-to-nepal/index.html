<h1>Testing in Nepal</h1>



<p>It's been quite some time since I last gave an update on FreePulse, but for a
good reason: I've been working around the clock to prepare for the first round
of in-hospital tests in Nepal!</p>
<img src="https://github.com/ReeceStevens/freepulse/raw/master/resources/prototype.jpg" alt="FreePulse System" style="width: 100%;">
<h2 id="what-we-ve-done-so-far">What We've Done So Far</h2>
<p>The GoFundMe for FreePulse received a humbling and overwhelming response this
summer, raising $1000 more than the projected goal. This generosity allowed me
to push forward prototyping the fully functional model of FreePulse, which led
to steady improvements in the design as well as a steady increase in the amount
of wires sprawled out across my desk.</p>
<img src="/images/messy_wires.JPG" alt="Messy Wires" style="width: 100%;">
<p>There were four major areas of improvement that version 1 of FreePulse
entailed, so I'll give a quick overview of the work that was done over the
latter part of 2016. Each of these topics could be a blog post in their own
right, and I aim to expand on them in more detail in the future.</p>
<h3 id="improvements-to-the-software">Improvements to the Software</h3>
<p>The software of FreePulse was completely revamped during the summer to
use a new modular, sandbox-like approach to displaying graphical elements like
signal traces and buttons. You can check out much of the progress on that front
in <a href="https://github.com/ReeceStevens/freepulse/pull/16">this PR</a> (and on that note, you can always be up-to-date on
the latest software progress by checking out the <a href="https://github.com/ReeceStevens/freepulse">FreePulse GitHub
page</a>!). More work is still to be done here, but these
modifications have laid the groundwork for expanding FreePulse's capabilities
to display many different kinds of modules and signals.</p>
<h3 id="addition-of-pulse-oximetery">Addition of Pulse Oximetery</h3>
<p>Using a sophisticated and efficient analog front-end chip from TI, a low-cost
and hardware-efficient pulse oximeter module was added to FreePulse. This
module accepts a standard DB-9 port probe, meaning it is compatible with a wide
array of existing pulse oximeter clips.</p>
<img src="/images/pulse_ox_dev.JPG" alt="Pulse Ox" style="width: 100%;">
<p>The software algorithms for calculating percent oxygen content are all
available on the GitHub page. These algorithms were determined empirically by
testing against gold-standard reference pulse oximeters and fine-tuning
calibration parameters.</p>
<h3 id="addition-of-semi-automatic-blood-pressure-measurement">Addition of Semi-Automatic Blood Pressure Measurement</h3>
<p>Using a standard connection hose that will fit virtually any existing blood
pressure cuff, the non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) unit was built to provide
simple blood pressure measurements at minimal cost and complexity. I added a DC
control valve and pressure sensor to control the release and detection of
pressure fluctuations in the cuff, and the extraction of pulse rate and blood
pressure were performed in software. What this means for the user is that in
order to take someone's blood pressure, you simply have to hit &quot;Start&quot; and pump
the cuff up to 200 mmHg with a hand pump. After the cuff is inflated, the
deflation and pressure detection is completely automated, making it a very
hands-off procedure.</p>
<img src="/images/nibp_circuit.JPG" alt="NIBP System" style="width: 100%;">
<h3 id="development-of-a-printed-circuit-board">Development of a Printed Circuit Board</h3>
<p>After spending so much time with this mess of wires on my desk, it was time to
translate that into a clean printed circuit board (PCB) that would be used in
the prototype devices. Working with Mrs. Barbara Burcham, an incredibly
talented (and patient!) PCB layout professional, we designed and revised a
circuit board that saved as much space as possible while retaining full
hardware functionality. I'm thrilled with the result, and the biggest testament
to Mrs. Burcham's talent is that the fully assembled board was able to be
programmed on the first print! That doesn't happen very often.</p>
<img src="/images/pcb_flashable.JPG" alt="PCB Flashable" style="width: 100%;">
<h2 id="preparing-for-the-first-hospital-test">Preparing for the First Hospital Test</h2>
<p>While improving the technical aspects of FreePulse, I also began working with
contacts in Nepal to organize on-the-ground tests of FreePulse's capabilities.
Two organizations played critical roles in supporting this effort: <a href="http://davidkvcs.com">Access
Health Care</a> and <a href="http://innolitics.com">Innolitics, LLC</a>. In addition to
this, an incredibly generous donation from Yujan and Mekha Shrestha was the
final gift that covered the rest of the budget for the proposed test trip. With
the support of these donors, the testing and evaluation was set for this coming
winter.</p>
<p>In preparation for this opportunity, a copious amount of background research
and testing was performed to ensure safety compliance and hospital readiness.
I began reaching out to doctors in Nepal and gauging community interest in the
project, and eventually I determined what hospitals would be optimal fits for
FreePulse's first on-the-ground test. After determining the hospitals, the full weight
of effort became preparing a prototype that would be functional both in its
operation as well as its form factor. I needed a PCB, and I needed a case!</p>
<img src="/images/microscope_board.jpg" alt="PCB Flashable" style="width: 100%;">
<img src="/images/pcb_assy.jpg" alt="PCB Flashable" style="width: 100%;">
<p>For the former, I used the PCB design that Mrs. Burcham and I were developing
and fabricated it using <a href="https://oshpark.com">OshPark</a>, a community-driven PCB
manufacturing site. I then modeled a case for the monitor in Solidworks and
fabricated it using an ABS 3D printer. Although the schedule was tight, two
functional FreePulse prototypes are now on the ground in Nepal!</p>
<h2 id="what-we-re-up-to-now">What We're Up To Now</h2>
<p>Videographer and media guru Madeleine Dunaway and I are on the ground beginning
our visitation of the three hospitals from which we will be testing FreePulse:
Amppipal Hospital, Okhaldhunga Community Hospital, and the Annapurna
Neurological Institute. Our goal is to demonstrate FreePulse's efficacy and
receive user feedback from doctors and nurses that will guide the development
of the next iteration of FreePulse. We are thrilled at the opportunity to work
with the doctors and nurses at these hospitals! We hope to build relationships
that will help us to better understand what needs are experienced by medical
professionals in the developing world and how we can design better medical
equipment to satisfy those needs.</p>
<p>I will be blogging about our experience here and sharing the lessons we are
learning, as well as sharing some footage of FreePulse in action in the field.
Stay tuned here or at the <a href="http://davidkvcs.com">Access Health Care blog</a> to get the latest
updates as we begin our adventure in Nepal!</p>
