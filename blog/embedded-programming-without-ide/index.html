<h1>Embedded Programming Without the IDE</h1>



<img src="/images/cli_workflow.png" alt="Command Line Workflow" style="width: 100%;">
<p>There are a few things I should disclose before I get into this post:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am a lover of all things terminal.</li>
<li>I am a big <code>vim</code> enthusiast (although certainly not an expert).</li>
<li>I love embedded development.</li>
<li>I really don't love programming in IDEs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, for most of my programming education, I believed that statements
3 and 4 were mutually exclusive. Every embedded project I had worked on
required the use of Keil uVision, Code Composer, Eclipse... the usual
suspects. There is nothing inherently wrong with any of these programs, and in
fact, they significantly lower the barrier to entry for embedded development.
They're widely used for a reason! </p>
<p>That said, I was always slightly frustrated when I
started a project by clicking through a wizard, selecting &quot;Project Template&quot;,
and seeing a bunch of mysterious files and directories pop up in my workspace.
What did all that stuff do? Why couldn't I see what was going on? What was all
this boilerplate code doing in my project, and was all that complexity really
necessary? When I would express this frustration to teammates, I would often
get replies like, &quot;Well you can just read the datasheet and program all the
registers manually if you want. Be my guest!&quot; Teams can be snarky sometimes. </p>
<p>And so, when I began working on FreePulse, I began researching to see if there
was a better way. Just before I had given up hope, I came across <a href="https://liviube.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/blink-for-stm32f4-discovery-board-on-linux-with-makefile/">this
wonderful blog post</a> detailing how the author had built
a Makefile for a project on the STM32F4 Discovery board. Seeing as I was
starting my redesign of FreePulse using the same chip, I decided to jump in and
try to drop Eclipse entirely. I'm really pleased with the result, and hopefully
this blog post can guide other people who want to develop for embedded
platforms independent of an IDE.</p>
<p>I'm going to do a brief overview of <code>make</code>, go through some specifics of how to
use <code>make</code> to perform most of the useful IDE compilation functions, and show
how you can integrate that into a very smooth development workflow using only
<code>vim</code> and the command line. Feel free to skip around if you feel like you've
got a good handle on how <code>make</code> works!</p>
<h2 id="introducing-the-makefile">Introducing the Makefile</h2>
<p>When starting out any coding project, one of the first things I do is try to
determine the layout of the program in a <code>Makefile</code>. From the people at the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Free Software Foundation</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>GNU Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other 
non-source files of a program from the program's source files. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">1</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>make</code> is pretty awesome. While I'm not going to do an exhaustive tutorial on
everything you can do with <code>make</code> (partly because that would take too long, and
partly because I'm still learning more all the time), I'll use it as a tool to
outline the structure of an embedded program. </p>
<p>A broad outline of an embedded development project, in <code>Makefile</code> syntax, would
be:</p>
<pre data-lang="make" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-make "><code class="language-make" data-lang="make"><span style="color:#65737e;"># Source Files (all *.c or *.cpp files)

</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">SRCS </span><span>+= </span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">path/to/my/second/source/file.c
</span><span style="color:#65737e;"># ...etc
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#65737e;"># Directories containing your header files (all *.h files)
</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">INC_DIRS  </span><span>= </span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">first/library/with/inc

</span><span>

</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#65737e;"># Linker Files (all *.ld files)

</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#65737e;"># Finally, tell make how to build the whole project
</span><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">final_binary.elf</span><span>: </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">$(</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">SRCS</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">)
</span><span>	</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">gcc </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">$(</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">INCLUDE</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">) $(</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">CFLAGS </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">$(</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">LFLAGS</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">) </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">$^ -o $@
</span></code></pre>
<p>Woah. While that may seem like a lot to take in, I promise that it's actually
very simple to understand! To break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We declare our source files, indicated by the .c or .cpp file extensions. These 
hold all the code that makes our awesome application, and it also holds any
source files required by the device libraries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We declare the folders that are holding all of our include files, indicated
by the .h file extension. Include files let our separate C/C++ files use
each others functions by holding function declarations, and you tell the
compiler what functions you want by the <code>#include &quot;somefile.h&quot;</code> directive.
It's really important to note (and easy to forget) that <strong>your different
source files don't automagically know what each other contain.</strong> If it isn't
declared in the header file and the header file isn't <code>#include</code>d in the
target file, it won't compile. The <code>addprefix</code> function at the end does just
what you'd expect, since our compiler needs the little <code>-I</code> flags in front of
our include directories to know to look there for our stuff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We declare any compiler options, or flags, that are necessary to make the
final binary file that will be saved in the microcontroller memory. I'll go
into exactly what flags you should use a little later in this post.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We declare all of the linker files, indicated by the .ld file extension, that
we need to use. Linker files are actually for another program by the people
at the Free Software Foundation, appropriately called <code>ld</code> (now the file
extension makes sense). <code>ld</code> is automatically called by <code>gcc</code> or <code>g++</code>, the
two primary C/C++ compilers, so we don't have to worry about the nitty
gritty. Basically though, <code>ld</code> helps tell the compiler <em>how</em> our program is
aligned when it's finally compiled. More on this later.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The last two blocks of this <code>Makefile</code> snippet is where the magic happens. 
These are rules, which <code>make</code> will use to compile your program. The syntax of
a rule is:</p>
<pre data-lang="make" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-make "><code class="language-make" data-lang="make"><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">target</span><span>: </span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">dependencies
</span><span>	</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">commands</span><span> to make target from dependencies
</span></code></pre>
<p>The first rule is a special kind of rule in <code>make</code> called a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Pattern-Rules.html#Pattern-Rules">pattern
rule</a>. This rule tells <code>make</code> that if we ever want to make
an object file (i.e. <code>target = %.o</code>) out of a source file (i.e. <code>dependencies = %.c</code>), we should use the commands specified below by the four-space
indentation. But what on earth was that command given in the example above?</p>
<pre data-lang="make" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-make "><code class="language-make" data-lang="make"><span style="color:#bf616a;">%</span><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">.o</span><span>: </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">%</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">.c
</span><span>	</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">gcc -c -o $@ $&lt; </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">$(</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">CFLAGS</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">)
</span></code></pre>
<p>As we've mentioned before, <code>gcc</code> is a compiler; the <code>-c</code> flag specifies that we
want to compile a source file, and the <code>-o</code> flag says that the next argument
will be the name of the output file. And that name is... <code>$@</code>?</p>
<p>Turns out, there's one last little thing about <code>make</code> we need to learn:
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html#Automatic-Variables">automatic variables</a>. You can read the doc page about all the
different automatic variables that <code>make</code> provides you, but we're going to
focus on the two that we just used here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>$@</code> represents whatever our <code>target</code> is. In this case, <code>$@ == %.o</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>$&lt;</code> represents the <strong>first</strong> dependency to the right of the colon. In this
case, since only one dependency is listed, <code>$&lt; == %.c</code>. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, after doing a little translation, we see that the pattern rule is telling
<code>make</code> that for every source file (<code>%.c</code>) that we want to turn into an object
file (<code>%.o</code>), it should call our compiler (<code>gcc</code>), tell it to compile (<code>-c</code>)
our source file (<code>$&lt;</code>) into the output file (<code>-o $@</code>) with some compiler
options that we specify (<code>$(CFLAGS)</code>). Not too bad! You're already on your way
to [groking][grok_article] <code>make</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, we have our last rule, which is where everything comes together. </p>
<pre data-lang="make" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-make "><code class="language-make" data-lang="make"><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">final_binary.elf</span><span>: </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">$(</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">SRCS</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">)
</span><span>	</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">gcc </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">$(</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">INCLUDE</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">) $(</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">CFLAGS</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">) $(</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">LFLAGS</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">) </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">$^ -o $@
</span></code></pre>
<p>We've pretty much covered everything in this rule except for the <code>$^</code> variable,
which is just another <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html#Automatic-Variables">automatic variable</a>. <code>$^</code> stands for
<em>every</em> file in the dependencies list, as opposed to <code>$&lt;</code>, which only
represents the <em>first</em>. A cheesy way to remember that is to look at the
direction of the arrow! And armed with that last little bit of knowledge, we
can confidently translate this last rule:</p>
<p>Take all our source files (<code>$(SRCS)</code>), and make them into a final output binary
called <code>final_binary.elf</code>. To do that, call our compiler (<code>gcc</code>), tell it where
our include directories are (<code>$(INCLUDE)</code>), specify our compiler options
(<code>$(CFLAGS)</code>) and our linker files (<code>$(LFLAGS)</code>), and finally give it all our
source files (<code>$^</code>) and tell it what we want the output to be (<code>-o $@</code>). </p>
<p>And just like that, we've outlined the basic build of a C/C++ project!</p>
<h2 id="make-make-work-for-embedded-programming">Make Make Work for Embedded Programming</h2>
<p>Because of some of the unique aspects of programming for a microcontroller, we
need to be a little more explicit with <code>make</code> about some things. This is where
<a href="https://liviube.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/blink-for-stm32f4-discovery-board-on-linux-with-makefile/">Liviu's blog post</a> really gave me some crucial
guidance; also, this is where we can see how building a <code>Makefile</code> lets us peek
into the mystery of what happens when we hit the &quot;compile and run&quot; button on an
IDE.</p>
<p>Firstly, we need to specify what kind of compiler we'll use. While you may have
<code>gcc</code> or <code>g++</code> installed on you machine, they are built to compile programs on 
your computer architecture. We'll need a special version of <code>gcc</code>, called a
<em>cross-compiler</em>, so that we can compile across architectures to the ARM
architecture. You can download it from <a href="https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded">this site mirror</a>, or
look for it in a package manager like <code>homebrew</code> (OSX), <code>apt-get</code> (Ubuntu), 
<code>pacman</code> (for Arch Linux), or similar for your distro. </p>
<p>Once you've got the cross-compiler toolset installed, the programs will<br />
probably have really long names (<code>arm-none-eabi-g++</code>, for example). That's
going to be a pain to type all over your <code>Makefile</code>, so you can make variables
to hold the path to your tools. I used <code>TOOLS_DIR</code> to hold the path to the
executables directory in the cross-compiler toolset, and then specified
the tools I'd be using:</p>
<pre data-lang="make" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-make "><code class="language-make" data-lang="make"><span style="color:#bf616a;">CC      </span><span>= </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">$(</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">TOOLS_DIR</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">)</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">/arm-none-eabi-g++
</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">OBJCOPY </span><span>= </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">$(</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">TOOLS_DIR</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">)</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">/arm-none-eabi-objcopy
</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">GDB     </span><span>= </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">$(</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">TOOLS_DIR</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">)</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">/arm-none-eabi-gdb
</span></code></pre>
<p>Next, we need to specify the <code>CFLAGS</code> that will help us to compile our program.
Liviu's <code>Makefile</code> was extremely helpful in that it logically grouped the
flags, so we can get a better idea of what's going on. I'm not going to give an
exact description of each flag (you can look up the linked docs for that), but I
will give an overview of each group:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CFLAGS  = -ggdb</code> sets <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Debugging-Options.html#Debugging-Options">debugging options</a> so that the compiler will send
information in a format that <code>gdb</code>, the debugging program we'll be using
later, can understand. </li>
<li><code>CFLAGS += -O0</code> tells the compiler to <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#Optimize-Options">perform no optimizations</a> on the code.
This is important for using the debugging program <code>gdb</code>. You can increase
this number later on, but only do so with thorough testing and once you are
ready to stop using <code>gdb</code>.</li>
<li><code>CFLAGS += -Wall -Wextra -Warray-bounds</code> all set <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html#Warning-Options">warning options</a>
so that the compiler will yell at you when certain conditions aren't met by
your code. Great for catching errors before runtime!</li>
<li><code>CFLAGS += -mlittle-endian -mthumb -mcpu=cortex-m4 -mthumb-interwork</code> all
tell the compiler <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Submodel-Options.html#Submodel-Options">machine-dependent options</a>. This is
information about the ARM processor (i.e. little endian, THUMB ISA, cortex-m4
cpu, etc.).</li>
<li><code>CFLAGS += -mfloat-abi=hard -mfpu=fpv4-sp-d16</code> tell the compiler more
machine-dependent options, but these specifically relate to the handling of
floating point numbers.</li>
<li><code>CFLAGS += -felide-constructors -std=c++0x</code> all specify <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">C++ language
options</a>. These are rules about C++ that the compiler will enforce,
allowing it to selectively allow or restrict whether some language feature
will compile. It isn't obvious at first glance what the <code>-felide-constructors</code>
flag does; however, it allows for a memory optimization during the use of
copy constructors in C++ (read docs for more info).</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we've gotten the <code>CFLAGS</code> straightened out, we can turn our focus to
making our life easier when we need to configure the project. The first thing
we'll want to do is specify our <code>SRC_DIRS</code>, much in the same way we specified
our <code>INC_DIRS</code>. The benefit to this is that we can then add the following
commands to our <code>Makefile</code>:</p>
<pre data-lang="make" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-make "><code class="language-make" data-lang="make"><span style="color:#b48ead;">vpath</span><span> %.c </span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">$(SRC_DIRS)
</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">vpath</span><span> %.cpp </span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">$(SRC_DIRS)
</span></code></pre>
<p>These commands will tell <code>make</code> to look in these source directories to find any
source file that it can't find in the current directory. Now, when we specify
the <code>SRCS</code> variable, we don't have to type out the full path to every source
file. Instead, we can just list the file name with no path:</p>
<pre data-lang="make" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-make "><code class="language-make" data-lang="make"><span style="color:#bf616a;">SRCS  </span><span>= </span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">main.cpp
</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">SRCS </span><span>+= </span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">other_file.cpp
</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">SRCS </span><span>+= </span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">other_file_in_other_directory.cpp
</span></code></pre>
<p>Finally, we're going to put all this <code>make</code> knowledge to good use and put
together a few more rules. Now that we have this great <code>Makefile</code> structure,
making new rules is a breeze:</p>
<pre data-lang="make" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-make "><code class="language-make" data-lang="make"><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">.PHONY</span><span>: </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">$(</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">PROJ_NAME</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">)

<p>Awesome! Now we've got a powerful suite of <code>make</code> rules. Let's see what we can
do now:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>make</code>: Just calling <code>make</code> by itself will trigger the first rule in the
file. In this case, it just calls our project name, which depends on the
final binary <code>.elf</code> file. How does <code>make</code> create that file? It looks up a
rule for it, and a match is found at rule 3! And thus, our program binary is
built using the compiler options and files we specified previously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>make clean</code>: This will delete all relevant output files from our workspace.
Great for making sure you have a clean start when you're rebuilding your
project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>make flash</code>: This will call an external program <a href="https://github.com/texane/stlink">st-flash</a> to flash a copy
of the .elf file with a .bin extension into the microcontroller. <code>0x8000000</code>
is a STM32F4-specific address where user code is supposed to be loaded.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these tools, we have made a master <code>Makefile</code> that does all the heavy
lifting of getting our sources, include paths, and configurations for ARM 
straightened out. Now we can focus on coding! Check out the <a href="https://github.com/ReeceStevens/freepulse/blob/master/Makefile">FreePulse
repository</a> for a real-world example of the Makefile we just 
outlined. </p>
<h2 id="coming-soon">Coming Soon...</h2>
<p>In my next blog post, I'm going to cover how you can use <code>vim</code> and the
<code>youcompleteme</code> autocompletion engine and syntax checker to build a light and
powerful coding workspace. Later in that post, I'll also cover how to build a 
simple command line console logger using the USART interface on the STM32F4.</p>
<p>Hopefully these posts will serve as useful references for how to begin an
embedded development project independent of an IDE! Feel free to check out the
<a href="https://github.com/ReeceStevens/freepulse">FreePulse repository</a> to see code examples of how this is 
implemented in a project.</p>
