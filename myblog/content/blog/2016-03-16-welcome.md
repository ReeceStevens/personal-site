A Sizeable Transition
-
My name is Reece Stevens. I'm a biomedical engineer who loves to program, build electronics, travel, and preferably do all three
at the same time. I've blogged before about my travel experiences (you can read about that [here][otherblog]),
but this blog will be more focused on the technical projects I have been working on. In particular, I will be discussing the development
of FreePulse, a low-cost patient monitor that was inspired by my time working in developing world hospitals in Rwanda and Nepal.

I'm looking forward to delving into some of the more interesting and difficult aspects of building things here, including both technical
challenges as well as business and life challenges. This blog won't be restricted to a single project, so hopefully some of these things
might be useful to you too!
