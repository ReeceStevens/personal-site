We are now two weeks into our time in Nepal performing preclinical testing on
FreePulse, a low-cost patient monitor designed for low-resource hospitals.
After spending our first week at [Amppipal Hospital][amppipal], we hopped into
a jeep and had a bumpy 10-hour ride to Okhaldhunga, a district just south of
the Solukhumbu region (of Mt. Everest fame). There, we began work at
[Okhaldhunga Community Hospital][och], a mission hospital that has been active in
developing innovative ways to provide better healthcare to their patients. I
had the privilege of working at Okhaldhunga Community Hospital a year ago as a
biomedical engineer with [Engineering World Health][ewh] and was introduced to
Dr. Erik and Kristen BÃ¸hler, an incredibly dedicated couple who have
devoted the last twelve years of their lives to growing and developing the
hospital at Okhaldhunga. After introducing Dr. Erik to FreePulse a year ago and
continuing our dialogue throughout the year over email, he was very excited to
follow up on the project and participate in preclinical trials.

When I arrived at Okhaldhunga, I was blown away at the amount of development
and improvement the hospital had made in the year since I had last visited.
The new main hospital building was now open, complete with two different
operating theaters; the emergency ward and microbiology lab were renovated
and outfitted with new equipment; and a guest house for expecting mothers was
recently completed. Everywhere I looked, I saw more buildings being constructed
and more improvements being made. It is this forward-looking mindset that makes
Okhaldhunga such a productive and exciting place to work, and I was thrilled to
continue building relationships at this hospital and perform FreePulse
preclinical trials here.

## Testing FreePulse In The OPD

The first morning began with the doctors' morning briefing. We all gathered in the
hospital administrator's office to touch base on the patients that came in
during the night shift. After summarizing the events of the previous night,
hospital director Tuk gave us the opportunity to introduce ourselves to the
staff and describe the purpose of our research. This was a great opportunity to
make more hospital staff aware of the project, and as a result, the head of
nursing found us a nursing student and set us up in the outpatient
department waiting room. We eagerly settled into our station and waited for the doors
to open at 9:00 AM.

*The bustling scene outside the outpatient department*

Like clockwork, patients began pouring into the OPD as soon as the
clock struck 9:00. The nursing staff sprung into action and worked with a dizzying
efficiency: the triage nurse took blood pressure, then sent patients to another
nursing student who recorded blood pressure and weight. After all these
parameters were recorded, patients were then sent to our station for evaluation
of the monitor before being directed to the OPD doctor. With so many patients
coming so quickly, I was worried we would slow down the patient flow of
the hospital!

*The waiting room was packed with people. Thankfully, we provided a bit of
entertainment to patients as they waited for their appointments.*

Once patients began coming our way, I decided that the nursing assistant should
operate the monitor as much as possible to simulate actual clinical use; I
simply attached the monitor to my computer, ran the data logger, and handed the
device to the nurse to begin measuring the patient. With so many patients
flowing through the OPD pipeline, we had to minimize time required to collect
data; after the first few trials, the nursing assistant was able to collect
all of the data for a patient in about 2 minutes.

Of all the experiences testing FreePulse in Nepal, watching the nursing
assistant use the monitor without any help was one of the most encouraging and
rewarding sights I had the privilege of witnessing. Engineers strive to design
systems that are so intuitive to use that they require no explanation, but this
goal is often very difficult to achieve. Seeing how quickly someone learned to
operate the device confirmed to me that FreePulse's design really is on the way
to achieving its goal of simplicity and intuitiveness!

At the end of testing that day, we had recorded 42 patients. It
was an exhausting flurry of activity and the highest density of data collection
for our entire time in Nepal-- but the lessons learned from the experience
extend well beyond the data collected and will benefit further development of
FreePulse for a long time to come.

## Building Relationships At Okhaldhunga

Even after wrapping up data collection at Okhaldhunga, there was still much
work to be done. Another critical goal of our time in Nepal is focused on
spending time with the doctors and staff of each hospital and better
understanding their needs and the challenges they face in providing medical care.
Okhaldhunga was an excellent place to learn because of how
open and welcoming the doctors and staff were; they expressed excitement and
engagement in the research of FreePulse and helped us as much as possible in
our work. In turn, we were able to help the hospital by volunteering time
fixing medical equipment and developing media content for the hospital. While
these tasks were not initially in the scope of our time at this hospital, they
turned out to be invaluable experiences for FreePulse.

*One interesting problem was a donated patient monitor stuck on a Norwegian
language setting. Pro tip: keep your language menus easily accessible!*

Firstly, by developing media content for the hospital, videographer Madeleine
Dunaway and I were able to observe all of the hospital wards and watch how care was
provided to many different patients. This gave me a better perspective on what
types of wards required the use of monitoring technology; in particular, the intensive
care unit and surgery wards. Those insights would not have been possible
without taking the time to tour the hospital.

Secondly, by spending time repairing broken equipment, I was able to survey
much of the medical equipment in the hospital and see how they were
being used in practice. I observed several advanced, newly donated patient
monitors installed in rooms where only pulse measurement and
blood pressure were being used. In addition to this, many pieces of equipment were unable to be
operated due to unstable wall voltage-- sometimes there would be no wall power
at all, whereas other times the voltage may surge to as much as 440 V AC. These
wild instabilities in power supply prevented many sophisticated devices from
being used in their intended fashion. Besides electrical difficulties, one
monitor in the emergency ward was even presenting a doctor with incorrect
blood pressure readings because it was too complicated to calibrate for each
patient. I observed that both technical resilience and a simplified design
are required for a device to perform at a high level consistently in
low-resource environments.

While it was not part of the clinical protocol, the time spent doing this
"extra" work was a vital part of our time at Okhaldhunga. It allowed us to
provide value to the hospital, build relationships with the staff, and gain
some great insight into the benefits that FreePulse can bring to to the
hospital and others like it throughout Nepal.

## Next Steps

Our final hospital, Annapurna Neurological Institute, comes right at the end of
our time in Nepal. After spending so many hours in bumpy jeep rides to remote
corners of the country, it will be a relief to spend the last few days in Kathmandu!
More posts to come as our time in Nepal comes to a close.
