Annapurna\nNeurological Institute, a private hospital in the heart of Kathmandu.\nAnnapurna Neuro was a distinct shift from the hospitals we had been visiting\nearlier in our trip: it is a towering five-story building with several\nspecialized wards, a wide range of medical technologies at its disposal, and a\nhealthy funding system. Instead of a general treatment hospital like Amppipal\nor Okhaldhunga, Annapurna Neuro specializes in (as the name suggests)\nneurological conditions and operations, making its patient population much more\nfocused. Even the aesthetics of the building suggests a thriving business,\nwith marble-floored hallways and comfortable waiting rooms.\n\nWhile it certainly wasn't the typical hospital for which FreePulse was\ntargeted, it was a crucial stop in our preclinical trials because it afforded\nthe singular opportunity to talk with Dr. Basant Pant, the brilliant and\ninnovative mind behind Annapurna Neuro. Dr. Pant is a gifted neurosurgeon-- in\nfact, he is one of only two practicing MD-PhDs in Nepal-- but some of his most\namazing contributions to the hospital have been his investment and research\ninto low-cost replacements to conventional medical equipment using locally\nsourced materials. Not only that, but Dr. Pant also has experience working in\ndisaster relief--  he offered his expert neurosurgical services to victims of\nthe catastrophic 2015 earthquake, helping Nepalis who otherwise would not have\nhad a chance at any kind of appropriate medical care. Given his extensive\nexperience in the field, I didn't want to pass up the opportunity to show him\nFreePulse and hear his feedback.\nMeeting Dr. Pant\nUpon arriving at the hospital, we were whisked upstairs to the neurosurgery\nward to find Dr. Pant prepping for an operation. Pausing his pre-surgery duties\n(he was ahead of schedule), he introduced himself and sat us down on a waiting\nroom couch. He was dressed in all-green scrubs and spoke with a business-like\nand brisk tone, but his eyes were sharp and curious. He had the same the kind\nof look you begin to recognize in inventive and adventurous individuals if you\nhang around them long enough.\nFrom the outset, I was struck by Dr. Pant's larger-than-life personality. He\nwas at once both inviting and investigative, listening intently to everything I\nhad to say and carefully constructing his responses. He had a well-deserved\nconfidence in his words and actions and exuded the kind of mental restraint and\ncool analysis that comes from a lifetime of performing life-or-death\nneurosurgical operations. As I introduced FreePulse to him and demonstrated the\nprototype, he absorbed every detail and tested the device himself.\nDr. Pant was very receptive to FreePulse, seeing it as having potential use\nboth in his hospital as well as mobile surgical units and lower-income\nhospitals. He was excited about the idea of having a lower-cost alternative to\na traditionally expensive piece of medical equipment; as far as he was\nconcerned, providing quality care at a lower cost meant that he could provide\ncare to more patients. Lowering equipment costs was something Dr. Pant believed\nvery strongly in, he told us, since he operates a for-profit hospital and any\nextra equipment costs would inevitably be passed down to the patient.\n\nThe waiting room of Annapurna Neuro. Dr. Pant's hospital offered more amenities\nto patients and their families due to its for-profit structuring.\nThe Power of Profitability\nAt first, I was confused by an apparent contradiction. I knew about Dr. Pant's\nhumanitarian work in earthquake relief and his dedication to the people of\nNepal, but this seemed at odds with the enterprising, for-profit hospital I was\ncurrently sitting in. How did these two seemingly disparate visions of health\ncare agree with each other? If Dr. Pant's intentions were to provide quality\nneurological medical care to all Nepalis, then why would he not operate his\nhospital as a non-profit venture? After spending time with Dr. Pant and\ndiscussing his opinion of FreePulse, his vision for the hospital, and his views\non healthcare in general, I began to understand more clearly where he was\ncoming from.\nDr. Pant operates on the principle that the chief way to help people is by\nproviding a sustainable service-- and implicit in that principle is the belief\nthat depending on outside donations and goodwill is not a sustainable\nenterprise. It was because of this stance that Dr. Pant told us quite\ndefinitively, \"I do not believe in nonprofits.\" While it is perhaps a startling\nstatement for those of us who have worked in nonprofit and volunteer capacities\nbefore (myself included), I can say that my experience working in hospitals in\nRwanda and Nepal have allowed me to understand the motivation behind that\nstatement. Sustainability is the most important factor to making a lasting\nimprovement to a hospital, and it is also virtually impossible to achieve\nthrough nonprofit initiatives alone.  Creating a sustainable business model, on\nthe other hand, incentivizes growth-- in other words, the biggest power of\nprofitability is sustainability.\nReliability Before Certification\nTo drive home this point, Dr. Pant then proceeded to tell us the story of a\nyoung engineer from India who had developed a low-cost neurosurgical navigation\nunit-- a device that shows neurosurgeons where they are in the brain while\nperforming an operation. This is a crucial piece of equipment with little room\nfor error, Dr. Pant told us, and so when a relatively unknown engineer came up\nwith a design for a low-cost unit, nobody was willing to test it. Dr. Pant met\nthe engineer and conducted performance tests of the device outside of the\nclinic, and found that it outperformed commercial equipment in almost every\naspect. After exhaustively evaluating the device, he was proud to tell us that\nhe is now using it as his primary navigation unit in surgery.\nThe point of this story was to drill down two crucial criteria necessary for a\nlow-cost medical device to succeed where it matters-- in the clinic. Firstly,\nin a paraphrase of Dr. Pant's words, \"certification of a device does not matter\nnearly as much as the device consistently performing the way it should. If it\nworks better than other equipment, I will use it.\" Reliability and accuracy of\nperformance are crucial to a device being adopted in a clinical context.\nHowever, Dr. Pant's second point was that a device must be equal parts reliable\nand cost-effective in order for it to actually provide effective care to the\npatients it is intended for.\nIt was a whirlwind meeting, and as soon as we shook hands, Dr. Pant leaped back\ninto preparing for surgery. He was performing a very delicate pediatric brain\ntumor removal that day, he told us, and the family had come directly to\nAnnapurna Neuro for the operation. Dr. Pant's reputation as the foremost\nneurosurgical authority precedes him in the Nepali medical community, and as we\nsaid goodbye and exited the surgery ward, I was confident that family was in\nthe best possible hands. It is entirely possible that without the effective\nlow-cost medical equipment Dr. Pant champions, that family would have not been\nable to afford the operation. Seeing Dr. Pant's dedication to patients and\nproviding accessible health care in an economically sustainable way was a truly\nincredible way to close out our time in Nepal.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/annapurna-neuro/","title":"Annapurna Neurological Institute"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/embedded-programming-without-ide/":{"body":"\nThere are a few things I should disclose before I get into this post:\n\nI am a lover of all things terminal.\nI am a big vim enthusiast (although certainly not an expert).\nI love embedded development.\nI really don't love programming in IDEs.\n\nUnfortunately, for most of my programming education, I believed that statements\n3 and 4 were mutually exclusive. Every embedded project I had worked on\nrequired the use of Keil uVision, Code Composer, Eclipse... the usual\nsuspects. There is nothing inherently wrong with any of these programs, and in\nfact, they significantly lower the barrier to entry for embedded development.\nThey're widely used for a reason! \nThat said, I was always slightly frustrated when I\nstarted a project by clicking through a wizard, selecting \"Project Template\",\nand seeing a bunch of mysterious files and directories pop up in my workspace.\nWhat did all that stuff do? Why couldn't I see what was going on? What was all\nthis boilerplate code doing in my project, and was all that complexity really\nnecessary? When I would express this frustration to teammates, I would often\nget replies like, \"Well you can just read the datasheet and program all the\nregisters manually if you want. Be my guest!\" Teams can be snarky sometimes. \nAnd so, when I began working on FreePulse, I began researching to see if there\nwas a better way. Just before I had given up hope, I came across this\nwonderful blog post detailing how the author had built\na Makefile for a project on the STM32F4 Discovery board. Seeing as I was\nstarting my redesign of FreePulse using the same chip, I decided to jump in and\ntry to drop Eclipse entirely. I'm really pleased with the result, and hopefully\nthis blog post can guide other people who want to develop for embedded\nplatforms independent of an IDE.\nI'm going to do a brief overview of make, go through some specifics of how to\nuse make to perform most of the useful IDE compilation functions, and show\nhow you can integrate that into a very smooth development workflow using only\nvim and the command line. Feel free to skip around if you feel like you've\ngot a good handle on how make works!\nIntroducing the Makefile\nWhen starting out any coding project, one of the first things I do is try to\ndetermine the layout of the program in a Makefile. From the people at the\nFree Software Foundation: \n\nGNU Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other \nnon-source files of a program from the program's source files. 1 \n\nmake is pretty awesome. While I'm not going to do an exhaustive tutorial on\neverything you can do with make (partly because that would take too long, and\npartly because I'm still learning more all the time), I'll use it as a tool to\noutline the structure of an embedded program. \nA broad outline of an embedded development project, in Makefile syntax, would\nbe:\n# Source Files (all *.c or *.cpp files)\nSRCS  = path/to/my/first/source/file.c\nSRCS += path/to/my/second/source/file.c\n# ...etc\n\n# Directories containing your header files (all *.h files)\nINC_DIRS  = first/library/with/inc\nINC_DIRS += second/library/with/inc\n# ...etc\nINCLUDE = $(addprefix -I,$(INC_DIRS))\n\n# Any compiler options you need to set\nCFLAGS  = -Wall \nCFLAGS += -std=c++11 # ...etc \n\n# Linker Files (all *.ld files)\nLFLAGS = -Tfirstfile.ld -Tsecondfile.ld\n\n# Tell make how to compile your *.c files into *.o files \n%.o: %.c\n\tgcc -c -o $@ $&lt; $(CFLAGS)\n\n# Finally, tell make how to build the whole project\nfinal_binary.elf: $(SRCS)\n\tgcc $(INCLUDE) $(CFLAGS $(LFLAGS) $^ -o $@\n\nWoah. While that may seem like a lot to take in, I promise that it's actually\nvery simple to understand! To break it down:\n\n\nWe declare our source files, indicated by the .c or .cpp file extensions. These \nhold all the code that makes our awesome application, and it also holds any\nsource files required by the device libraries.\n\n\nWe declare the folders that are holding all of our include files, indicated\nby the .h file extension. Include files let our separate C/C++ files use\neach others functions by holding function declarations, and you tell the\ncompiler what functions you want by the #include \"somefile.h\" directive.\nIt's really important to note (and easy to forget) that your different\nsource files don't automagically know what each other contain. If it isn't\ndeclared in the header file and the header file isn't #included in the\ntarget file, it won't compile. The addprefix function at the end does just\nwhat you'd expect, since our compiler needs the little -I flags in front of\nour include directories to know to look there for our stuff.\n\n\nWe declare any compiler options, or flags, that are necessary to make the\nfinal binary file that will be saved in the microcontroller memory. I'll go\ninto exactly what flags you should use a little later in this post.\n\n\nWe declare all of the linker files, indicated by the .ld file extension, that\nwe need to use. Linker files are actually for another program by the people\nat the Free Software Foundation, appropriately called ld (now the file\nextension makes sense). ld is automatically called by gcc or g++, the\ntwo primary C/C++ compilers, so we don't have to worry about the nitty\ngritty. Basically though, ld helps tell the compiler how our program is\naligned when it's finally compiled. More on this later.\n\n\nThe last two blocks of this Makefile snippet is where the magic happens. \nThese are rules, which make will use to compile your program. The syntax of\na rule is:\ntarget: dependencies\n\tcommands to make target from dependencies\n\nThe first rule is a special kind of rule in make called a pattern\nrule. This rule tells make that if we ever want to make\nan object file (i.e. target = %.o) out of a source file (i.e. dependencies = %.c), we should use the commands specified below by the four-space\nindentation. But what on earth was that command given in the example above?\n%.o: %.c\n\tgcc -c -o $@ $&lt; $(CFLAGS)\n\nAs we've mentioned before, gcc is a compiler; the -c flag specifies that we\nwant to compile a source file, and the -o flag says that the next argument\nwill be the name of the output file. And that name is... $@?\nTurns out, there's one last little thing about make we need to learn:\nautomatic variables. You can read the doc page about all the\ndifferent automatic variables that make provides you, but we're going to\nfocus on the two that we just used here:\n\n\n$@ represents whatever our target is. In this case, $@ == %.o.\n\n\n$&lt; represents the first dependency to the right of the colon. In this\ncase, since only one dependency is listed, $&lt; == %.c. \n\n\nSo, after doing a little translation, we see that the pattern rule is telling\nmake that for every source file (%.c) that we want to turn into an object\nfile (%.o), it should call our compiler (gcc), tell it to compile (-c)\nour source file ($&lt;) into the output file (-o $@) with some compiler\noptions that we specify ($(CFLAGS)). Not too bad! You're already on your way\nto [groking][grok_article] make.\nFinally, we have our last rule, which is where everything comes together. \nfinal_binary.elf: $(SRCS)\n\tgcc $(INCLUDE) $(CFLAGS) $(LFLAGS) $^ -o $@\n\nWe've pretty much covered everything in this rule except for the $^ variable,\nwhich is just another automatic variable. $^ stands for\nevery file in the dependencies list, as opposed to $&lt;, which only\nrepresents the first. A cheesy way to remember that is to look at the\ndirection of the arrow! And armed with that last little bit of knowledge, we\ncan confidently translate this last rule:\nTake all our source files ($(SRCS)), and make them into a final output binary\ncalled final_binary.elf. To do that, call our compiler (gcc), tell it where\nour include directories are ($(INCLUDE)), specify our compiler options\n($(CFLAGS)) and our linker files ($(LFLAGS)), and finally give it all our\nsource files ($^) and tell it what we want the output to be (-o $@). \nAnd just like that, we've outlined the basic build of a C/C++ project!\nMake Make Work for Embedded Programming\nBecause of some of the unique aspects of programming for a microcontroller, we\nneed to be a little more explicit with make about some things. This is where\nLiviu's blog post really gave me some crucial\nguidance; also, this is where we can see how building a Makefile lets us peek\ninto the mystery of what happens when we hit the \"compile and run\" button on an\nIDE.\nFirstly, we need to specify what kind of compiler we'll use. While you may have\ngcc or g++ installed on you machine, they are built to compile programs on \nyour computer architecture. We'll need a special version of gcc, called a\ncross-compiler, so that we can compile across architectures to the ARM\narchitecture. You can download it from this site mirror, or\nlook for it in a package manager like homebrew (OSX), apt-get (Ubuntu), \npacman (for Arch Linux), or similar for your distro. \nOnce you've got the cross-compiler toolset installed, the programs will\nprobably have really long names (arm-none-eabi-g++, for example). That's\ngoing to be a pain to type all over your Makefile, so you can make variables\nto hold the path to your tools. I used TOOLS_DIR to hold the path to the\nexecutables directory in the cross-compiler toolset, and then specified\nthe tools I'd be using:\nCC      = $(TOOLS_DIR)/arm-none-eabi-g++\nOBJCOPY = $(TOOLS_DIR)/arm-none-eabi-objcopy\nGDB     = $(TOOLS_DIR)/arm-none-eabi-gdb\n\nNext, we need to specify the CFLAGS that will help us to compile our program.\nLiviu's Makefile was extremely helpful in that it logically grouped the\nflags, so we can get a better idea of what's going on. I'm not going to give an\nexact description of each flag (you can look up the linked docs for that), but I\nwill give an overview of each group:\n\nCFLAGS  = -ggdb sets debugging options so that the compiler will send\ninformation in a format that gdb, the debugging program we'll be using\nlater, can understand. \nCFLAGS += -O0 tells the compiler to perform no optimizations on the code.\nThis is important for using the debugging program gdb. You can increase\nthis number later on, but only do so with thorough testing and once you are\nready to stop using gdb.\nCFLAGS += -Wall -Wextra -Warray-bounds all set warning options\nso that the compiler will yell at you when certain conditions aren't met by\nyour code. Great for catching errors before runtime!\nCFLAGS += -mlittle-endian -mthumb -mcpu=cortex-m4 -mthumb-interwork all\ntell the compiler machine-dependent options. This is\ninformation about the ARM processor (i.e. little endian, THUMB ISA, cortex-m4\ncpu, etc.).\nCFLAGS += -mfloat-abi=hard -mfpu=fpv4-sp-d16 tell the compiler more\nmachine-dependent options, but these specifically relate to the handling of\nfloating point numbers.\nCFLAGS += -felide-constructors -std=c++0x all specify C++ language\noptions. These are rules about C++ that the compiler will enforce,\nallowing it to selectively allow or restrict whether some language feature\nwill compile. It isn't obvious at first glance what the -felide-constructors\nflag does; however, it allows for a memory optimization during the use of\ncopy constructors in C++ (read docs for more info).\n\nNow that we've gotten the CFLAGS straightened out, we can turn our focus to\nmaking our life easier when we need to configure the project. The first thing\nwe'll want to do is specify our SRC_DIRS, much in the same way we specified\nour INC_DIRS. The benefit to this is that we can then add the following\ncommands to our Makefile:\nvpath %.c $(SRC_DIRS)\nvpath %.cpp $(SRC_DIRS)\n\nThese commands will tell make to look in these source directories to find any\nsource file that it can't find in the current directory. Now, when we specify\nthe SRCS variable, we don't have to type out the full path to every source\nfile. Instead, we can just list the file name with no path:\nSRCS  = main.cpp\nSRCS += other_file.cpp\nSRCS += other_file_in_other_directory.cpp\n\nFinally, we're going to put all this make knowledge to good use and put\ntogether a few more rules. Now that we have this great Makefile structure,\nmaking new rules is a breeze:\n.PHONY: $(PROJ_NAME)\n$(PROJ_NAME): $(PROJ_NAME).elf\n\n%.o: %.c \n\t$(CC) -c -o $@ $&lt; $(CFLAGS)\n\n$(PROJ_NAME).elf: $(SRCS)\n\t$(CC) $(INCLUDE) $(DEFS) $(CFLAGS) $(LFLAGS) $^ -o $@ \n\t$(OBJCOPY) -O ihex $(PROJ_NAME).elf   $(PROJ_NAME).hex\n\t$(OBJCOPY) -O binary $(PROJ_NAME).elf $(PROJ_NAME).bin\n\nclean:\n\trm -f *.o $(PROJ_NAME).elf $(PROJ_NAME).hex $(PROJ_NAME).bin\n\nflash: \n\tst-flash write $(PROJ_NAME).bin 0x8000000\n\nAwesome! Now we've got a powerful suite of make rules. Let's see what we can\ndo now:\n\n\nmake: Just calling make by itself will trigger the first rule in the\nfile. In this case, it just calls our project name, which depends on the\nfinal binary .elf file. How does make create that file? It looks up a\nrule for it, and a match is found at rule 3! And thus, our program binary is\nbuilt using the compiler options and files we specified previously.\n\n\nmake clean: This will delete all relevant output files from our workspace.\nGreat for making sure you have a clean start when you're rebuilding your\nproject.\n\n\nmake flash: This will call an external program st-flash to flash a copy\nof the .elf file with a .bin extension into the microcontroller. 0x8000000\nis a STM32F4-specific address where user code is supposed to be loaded.\n\n\nUsing these tools, we have made a master Makefile that does all the heavy\nlifting of getting our sources, include paths, and configurations for ARM \nstraightened out. Now we can focus on coding! Check out the FreePulse\nrepository for a real-world example of the Makefile we just \noutlined. \nComing Soon...\nIn my next blog post, I'm going to cover how you can use vim and the\nyoucompleteme autocompletion engine and syntax checker to build a light and\npowerful coding workspace. Later in that post, I'll also cover how to build a \nsimple command line console logger using the USART interface on the STM32F4.\nHopefully these posts will serve as useful references for how to begin an\nembedded development project independent of an IDE! Feel free to check out the\nFreePulse repository to see code examples of how this is \nimplemented in a project.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/embedded-programming-without-ide/","title":"Embedded Programming Without the IDE"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/freepulse-going-to-nepal/":{"body":"It's been quite some time since I last gave an update on FreePulse, but for a\ngood reason: I've been working around the clock to prepare for the first round\nof in-hospital tests in Nepal!\n\nWhat We've Done So Far\nThe GoFundMe for FreePulse received a humbling and overwhelming response this\nsummer, raising $1000 more than the projected goal. This generosity allowed me\nto push forward prototyping the fully functional model of FreePulse, which led\nto steady improvements in the design as well as a steady increase in the amount\nof wires sprawled out across my desk.\n\nThere were four major areas of improvement that version 1 of FreePulse\nentailed, so I'll give a quick overview of the work that was done over the\nlatter part of 2016. Each of these topics could be a blog post in their own\nright, and I aim to expand on them in more detail in the future.\nImprovements to the Software\nThe software of FreePulse was completely revamped during the summer to\nuse a new modular, sandbox-like approach to displaying graphical elements like\nsignal traces and buttons. You can check out much of the progress on that front\nin this PR (and on that note, you can always be up-to-date on\nthe latest software progress by checking out the FreePulse GitHub\npage!). More work is still to be done here, but these\nmodifications have laid the groundwork for expanding FreePulse's capabilities\nto display many different kinds of modules and signals.\nAddition of Pulse Oximetery\nUsing a sophisticated and efficient analog front-end chip from TI, a low-cost\nand hardware-efficient pulse oximeter module was added to FreePulse. This\nmodule accepts a standard DB-9 port probe, meaning it is compatible with a wide\narray of existing pulse oximeter clips.\n\nThe software algorithms for calculating percent oxygen content are all\navailable on the GitHub page. These algorithms were determined empirically by\ntesting against gold-standard reference pulse oximeters and fine-tuning\ncalibration parameters.\nAddition of Semi-Automatic Blood Pressure Measurement\nUsing a standard connection hose that will fit virtually any existing blood\npressure cuff, the non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) unit was built to provide\nsimple blood pressure measurements at minimal cost and complexity. I added a DC\ncontrol valve and pressure sensor to control the release and detection of\npressure fluctuations in the cuff, and the extraction of pulse rate and blood\npressure were performed in software. What this means for the user is that in\norder to take someone's blood pressure, you simply have to hit \"Start\" and pump\nthe cuff up to 200 mmHg with a hand pump. After the cuff is inflated, the\ndeflation and pressure detection is completely automated, making it a very\nhands-off procedure.\n\nDevelopment of a Printed Circuit Board\nAfter spending so much time with this mess of wires on my desk, it was time to\ntranslate that into a clean printed circuit board (PCB) that would be used in\nthe prototype devices. Working with Mrs. Barbara Burcham, an incredibly\ntalented (and patient!) PCB layout professional, we designed and revised a\ncircuit board that saved as much space as possible while retaining full\nhardware functionality. I'm thrilled with the result, and the biggest testament\nto Mrs. Burcham's talent is that the fully assembled board was able to be\nprogrammed on the first print! That doesn't happen very often.\n\nPreparing for the First Hospital Test\nWhile improving the technical aspects of FreePulse, I also began working with\ncontacts in Nepal to organize on-the-ground tests of FreePulse's capabilities.\nTwo organizations played critical roles in supporting this effort: Access\nHealth Care and Innolitics, LLC. In addition to\nthis, an incredibly generous donation from Yujan and Mekha Shrestha was the\nfinal gift that covered the rest of the budget for the proposed test trip. With\nthe support of these donors, the testing and evaluation was set for this coming\nwinter.\nIn preparation for this opportunity, a copious amount of background research\nand testing was performed to ensure safety compliance and hospital readiness.\nI began reaching out to doctors in Nepal and gauging community interest in the\nproject, and eventually I determined what hospitals would be optimal fits for\nFreePulse's first on-the-ground test. After determining the hospitals, the full weight\nof effort became preparing a prototype that would be functional both in its\noperation as well as its form factor. I needed a PCB, and I needed a case!\n\n\nFor the former, I used the PCB design that Mrs. Burcham and I were developing\nand fabricated it using OshPark, a community-driven PCB\nmanufacturing site. I then modeled a case for the monitor in Solidworks and\nfabricated it using an ABS 3D printer. Although the schedule was tight, two\nfunctional FreePulse prototypes are now on the ground in Nepal!\nWhat We're Up To Now\nVideographer and media guru Madeleine Dunaway and I are on the ground beginning\nour visitation of the three hospitals from which we will be testing FreePulse:\nAmppipal Hospital, Okhaldhunga Community Hospital, and the Annapurna\nNeurological Institute. Our goal is to demonstrate FreePulse's efficacy and\nreceive user feedback from doctors and nurses that will guide the development\nof the next iteration of FreePulse. We are thrilled at the opportunity to work\nwith the doctors and nurses at these hospitals! We hope to build relationships\nthat will help us to better understand what needs are experienced by medical\nprofessionals in the developing world and how we can design better medical\nequipment to satisfy those needs.\nI will be blogging about our experience here and sharing the lessons we are\nlearning, as well as sharing some footage of FreePulse in action in the field.\nStay tuned here or at the Access Health Care blog to get the latest\nupdates as we begin our adventure in Nepal!\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/freepulse-going-to-nepal/","title":"Testing in Nepal"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/lessons-from-amppipal/":{"body":"\nThe front entrance to Amppipal Hospital\nAlready my time at the first hospital of our tests in Nepal has come to a close, and what an\nexperience it has been. Amppipal was vital in setting the stage for the rest of\nthis trip. It taught me about some of the realities of performing medical research in\ndeveloping countries, and I am better prepared for the challenges to come\nbecause of the experiences I had there.\n\nAmppipal Hospital and the stunning view of the Himalayas\nAmppipal is a small town north of Dumre, and its hospital is nestled in between\ntwo hills facing the Annapurna mountain range. The hospital is separated from the main highway by a\n45-minute bumpy jeep ride over unpaved mountain road, but the village around the\nhospital is bursting with life. \nAnything That Can Go Wrong...\nAs is often the case while working in resource-constrained environments,\nwe began to encounter difficulties due to circumstances beyond our control. I\ndiscovered the first big hurdle while unpacking: the FreePulse prototype was\ndamaged during our particularly bumpy ride!\n\nUsing a knife to reposition a pressure chip pad. Amazingly, it actually\nworked.\nDuring transit, the pressure sensor chip for the blood pressure circuit got\nyanked off of its pads on the board. In order to take blood pressure\nmeasurements at Amppipal, I would need to fix this chip before beginning\ntesting-- however, I had a very limited set of tools on hand to fix the sensor\nchip in the right position (essentially just a knife and epoxy). Thankfully,\nthe director of the hospital was out of town for the day, moving our start day\nback to Sunday. This gave me a large time window to make the fix, and so I\nfocused on repairing the device and getting everything up and running.\nSure enough, by the time Sunday came around I managed to tack down the NIBP chip using\na borrowed soldering iron and spare epoxy. We met the hospital director, Mr.\nBaburam Giri, who very graciously gave approval for us to work in the\noutpatient department starting that afternoon. However, after gathering our things and\npreparing for the afternoon start time, I began to have an unsettling\nfeeling that grew to a full-out flu-like illness. I was completely\nincapacitated by the time testing was supposed to begin, and so we (grudgingly)\npushed the start time to early the next morning.\n\nWe took precautions and wore facemasks and sanitized after every patient\nFinally, I awoke the next morning feeling marginally better and ready for\naction. Armed with facemasks and plenty of hand sanitizer, we set up a station\nin the outpatient department and saw the first few patients of our trials in\nNepal! The nurses were incredibly helpful with communication as we\nexplained the purpose of the trial to each participant. When we broke for\nlunch, we were on track to get ten patients recorded before the end of the day.\n\nWe performed some measurements outside in the OPD waiting area. The pulse ox\nprobe got accurate readings, even in the crazy ambient lighting!\nAfter lunch, things seemed fairly quiet. After waiting in our testing room for a few\nminutes, I wandered outside to ask one of the nurses if there were any\npatients. Lo and behold, she informed me that there were no patients left in\nthe outpatient department, so they had closed for the day at 2 PM! The people\nI had seen outside were simply villagers who were hanging out in the\noutpatient waiting area!\n\nWaiting in an empty room, pondering where all the patients went\nAll in all at Amppipal, we fixed one broken patient monitor, rode in over 1.5 hours\nof unpaved road, overcame one flu-like illness, tested five patients, saw some \nincredible mountains, and met some truly incredible people.\n\nDr. Shrestha tried out FreePulse and gave great feedback about the device\nLive and Learn\nAmppipal was an excellent learning experience, as a couple of key truths\nabout working in remote settings were reinforced to me. Firstly, it is critical\nto always design redundantly so that even when the pressure sensor chip twists\noff its pads (or any other range of improbable errors occur), the monitor keeps\nworking as expected. Built-in redundancy is the only line of defense that\nexists when you are outside the reach of spare parts or sophisticated\nelectronics tools-- it's crucial to invest in making it strong during the\ndesign phase.\nSecondly, this redundancy should also apply to your experimental procedure and\nscheduling. Especially in hospital settings, schedules are often at the mercy\nof the availability of administrators and doctors, and preparing for this ahead\nof time will save lots of headache and stress.\nThirdly, trust the staff! The nurses and doctors at these hospitals are skilled\nand willing to help in everything from communication to taking somebody's blood\npressure, or serving as a helper during testing. I was astonished by the level\nof generosity the staff at Amppipal showed us during our stay, and for that I am\nextremely grateful.\n\nThe picturesque view we were greeted with every evening from the guest house\nWe are now preparing for the second hospital of our tests: Okhaldhunga\nCommunity Hospital. Armed with these experiences and lessons, I hope to make it\nan even more exciting and productive time-- and I cannot wait to report on all\nof the adventures we'll have!\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/lessons-from-amppipal/","title":"Lessons from Amppipal"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/making-progress-at-okhaldhunga/":{"body":"\nWe are now two weeks into our time in Nepal performing preclinical testing on\nFreePulse, a low-cost patient monitor designed for low-resource hospitals.\nAfter spending our first week at Amppipal Hospital, we hopped into\na jeep and had a bumpy 10-hour ride to Okhaldhunga, a district just south of\nthe Solukhumbu region (of Mt. Everest fame). There, we began work at\nOkhaldhunga Community Hospital, a mission hospital that has been active in\ndeveloping innovative ways to provide better healthcare to their patients. I\nhad the privilege of working at Okhaldhunga Community Hospital a year ago as a\nbiomedical engineer with Engineering World Health and was introduced to\nDr. Erik and Kristen Bøhler, an incredibly dedicated couple who have\ndevoted the last twelve years of their lives to growing and developing the\nhospital at Okhaldhunga. After introducing Dr. Erik to FreePulse a year ago and\ncontinuing our dialogue throughout the year over email, he was very excited to\nfollow up on the project and participate in preclinical trials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Left: Okhaldhunga one year ago during my time with EWH. Right: Okhaldhunga today.*\n\nDr. Erik was kind enough to invite us to his house for a dinner of pancakes,\nbible study, and an excellent carafe of french-pressed coffee\nWhen I arrived at Okhaldhunga, I was blown away at the amount of development\nand improvement the hospital had made in the year since I had last visited.\nThe new main hospital building was now open, complete with two different\noperating theaters; the emergency ward and microbiology lab were renovated\nand outfitted with new equipment; and a guest house for expecting mothers was\nrecently completed. Everywhere I looked, I saw more buildings being constructed\nand more improvements being made. It is this forward-looking mindset that makes\nOkhaldhunga such a productive and exciting place to work, and I was thrilled to\ncontinue building relationships at this hospital and perform FreePulse\npreclinical trials here.\n\nThe new and improved emergency ward at Okhaldhunga\nTesting FreePulse In The OPD\nThe first morning began with the doctors' morning briefing. We all gathered in the\nhospital administrator's office to touch base on the patients that came in\nduring the night shift. After summarizing the events of the previous night,\nhospital director Tuk gave us the opportunity to introduce ourselves to the\nstaff and describe the purpose of our research. This was a great opportunity to\nmake more hospital staff aware of the project, and as a result, the head of\nnursing found us a nursing student and set us up in the outpatient\ndepartment waiting room. We eagerly settled into our station and waited for the doors\nto open at 9:00 AM.\n\nThe bustling scene outside the outpatient department\nLike clockwork, patients began pouring into the OPD as soon as the\nclock struck 9:00. The nursing staff sprung into action and worked with a dizzying\nefficiency: the triage nurse took blood pressure, then sent patients to another\nnursing student who recorded blood pressure and weight. After all these\nparameters were recorded, patients were then sent to our station for evaluation\nof the monitor before being directed to the OPD doctor. With so many patients\ncoming so quickly, I was worried we would slow down the patient flow of\nthe hospital!\n\nThe waiting room was packed with people. Thankfully, we provided a bit of\nentertainment to patients as they waited for their appointments.\nOnce patients began coming our way, I decided that the nursing assistant should\noperate the monitor as much as possible to simulate actual clinical use; I\nsimply attached the monitor to my computer, ran the data logger, and handed the\ndevice to the nurse to begin measuring the patient. With so many patients\nflowing through the OPD pipeline, we had to minimize time required to collect\ndata; after the first few trials, the nursing assistant was able to collect\nall of the data for a patient in about 2 minutes.\n\nOur incredibly helpful nurse applies the blood pressure cuff and pulse\noximeter clip to a patient\nOf all the experiences testing FreePulse in Nepal, watching the nursing\nassistant use the monitor without any help was one of the most encouraging and\nrewarding sights I had the privilege of witnessing. Engineers strive to design\nsystems that are so intuitive to use that they require no explanation, but this\ngoal is often very difficult to achieve. Seeing how quickly someone learned to\noperate the device confirmed to me that FreePulse's design really is on the way\nto achieving its goal of simplicity and intuitiveness!\n\nWe all watch the readings from FreePulse\nAt the end of testing that day, we had recorded 42 patients. It\nwas an exhausting flurry of activity and the highest density of data collection\nfor our entire time in Nepal-- but the lessons learned from the experience\nextend well beyond the data collected and will benefit further development of\nFreePulse for a long time to come.\n\nWe thought we were going to measure the mother, but then she handed us her\nbaby! The probe was a bit too big, but the mother was happy that we tried.\nBuilding Relationships At Okhaldhunga\nEven after wrapping up data collection at Okhaldhunga, there was still much\nwork to be done. Another critical goal of our time in Nepal is focused on\nspending time with the doctors and staff of each hospital and better\nunderstanding their needs and the challenges they face in providing medical care.\nOkhaldhunga was an excellent place to learn because of how\nopen and welcoming the doctors and staff were; they expressed excitement and\nengagement in the research of FreePulse and helped us as much as possible in\nour work. In turn, we were able to help the hospital by volunteering time\nfixing medical equipment and developing media content for the hospital. While\nthese tasks were not initially in the scope of our time at this hospital, they\nturned out to be invaluable experiences for FreePulse.\n\nOne interesting problem was a donated patient monitor stuck on a Norwegian\nlanguage setting. Pro tip: keep your language menus easily accessible!\nFirstly, by developing media content for the hospital, videographer Madeleine\nDunaway and I were able to observe all of the hospital wards and watch how care was\nprovided to many different patients. This gave me a better perspective on what\ntypes of wards required the use of monitoring technology; in particular, the intensive\ncare unit and surgery wards. Those insights would not have been possible\nwithout taking the time to tour the hospital.\n\nThe new main hospital building at Okhaldhunga\nSecondly, by spending time repairing broken equipment, I was able to survey\nmuch of the medical equipment in the hospital and see how they were\nbeing used in practice. I observed several advanced, newly donated patient\nmonitors installed in rooms where only pulse measurement and\nblood pressure were being used. In addition to this, many pieces of equipment were unable to be\noperated due to unstable wall voltage-- sometimes there would be no wall power\nat all, whereas other times the voltage may surge to as much as 440 V AC. These\nwild instabilities in power supply prevented many sophisticated devices from\nbeing used in their intended fashion. Besides electrical difficulties, one\nmonitor in the emergency ward was even presenting a doctor with incorrect\nblood pressure readings because it was too complicated to calibrate for each\npatient. I observed that both technical resilience and a simplified design\nare required for a device to perform at a high level consistently in\nlow-resource environments.\n\nTrying to repair a broken (and aged) colorimeter in the laboratory\nWhile it was not part of the clinical protocol, the time spent doing this\n\"extra\" work was a vital part of our time at Okhaldhunga. It allowed us to\nprovide value to the hospital, build relationships with the staff, and gain\nsome great insight into the benefits that FreePulse can bring to to the\nhospital and others like it throughout Nepal.\nNext Steps\nOur final hospital, Annapurna Neurological Institute, comes right at the end of\nour time in Nepal. After spending so many hours in bumpy jeep rides to remote\ncorners of the country, it will be a relief to spend the last few days in Kathmandu!\nMore posts to come as our time in Nepal comes to a close.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/making-progress-at-okhaldhunga/","title":"Making Progress At Okhaldhunga"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/perspectives-on-rust/":{"body":"During the redesign of FreePulse following the Nepal pre-clinical trials, I\nmade the decision to re-write the software in the Rust programming\nlanguage. This decision had far-reaching consequences for the\nproject, and I wanted to delve a little bit into the motivation for this\ndecision, the benefits Rust has provided FreePulse, and my experiences with\ndeep-diving into the world of Rust embedded development.\nTo be clear: I am not a Rust expert. However, I would make the case that you\ndon't have to be a Rust expert in order to take advantage of a lot of the\nbenefit that Rust offers as a language. It's not without its warts, but overall\nI feel that the quality, maintanability, and simplicity of the FreePulse\ncodebase has significantly improved as a result of the rewrite.\nMotivation for Changing Languages\nFreePulse was originally written in C++ (the old-repository is open-sourced\nhere). I used the low-level HAL that was provided with\nthe STM32F4 chip in order to interface with the hardware and wrote my own\nwrappers around accessing peripherals such as GPIO, SPI, and USART. From there,\nI built out my application-specific logic as a simple update loop that iterated\nthrough a set of \"modules\" (in reality, they were monolithic C++ classes) that\neach provided an .update() method. Unit testing was limited at best.\nOver time, I have learned much more about software best practices and the\nimportance of writing maintainable code. There are several design \"red-flags\" in\nthe old code base that made it very difficult to introduce changes without\nbreaking things: the monolithic classes were difficult to debug, state was\nspread over multiple places in the code, and control flow was pretty difficult\nto reason about. Perhaps even more importantly, the single-loop style of\nupdating meant that there was no way to specify the priority of different\ntasks. The ECG sampler could not measure until the screen was done painting;\nthe pulse oximeter calibration would block all UI updates; high priority tasks\nwere at the mercy of their slower counterparts, and it was impossible to\nprovide timing guarantees on samplers. As the complexity of the software grew,\nthese issues become more and more difficult to work around. As a result, I\ndecided that FreePulse needed to be re-written to be multi-threaded.\nOf course, \"multi-threaded\" in an embedded system generally means concurrency\nvia interrupt-based programming (as opposed to\nparallelism, i.e. multiple cores of a CPU\nperforming operations simultaneously). Even though the embedded system only has\na single core processor, we conceptually want the ability to describe\nmultiple independent processes that are running simultaneously. In\ninterrupt-based programming, we define an \"idle\" thread that is the lowest\npriority task; we then define a set of other tasks that run at defined\nintervals or in response to hardware events, each with a priority level that\ndetermines whether it can preempt the currently running task when triggered.\nThis model is supported by the hardware in most embedded systems through the\nuse of the Nested Vector Interrupt Controller, or NVIC; it allows hardware\nevents to trigger execution of certain code hooks. Furthermore, each event has\na user-configurable priority level, allowing higher-priority events to preempt\nthe handling of lower-priority events.\nThe mechanisms of multi-threading aside, developing the logic of a\nmulti-threaded application is a complex and error-prone task. Even the most\ndiligent of engineers can be tripped up by multi-threaded bugs, which often\nmanifest themselves in mysterious ways and can be notoriously hard to debug.\nThis problem is one of the primary motivators for using the Rust language,\nwhich provides compile-time guarantees of concurrency safety by the use of its\nborrow checker. This doesn't make concurrent code in Rust completely\nbulletproof, but it does eliminate whole classes of bugs that otherwise would\nbe quite difficult to identify and fix.\nConcurrency safety wasn't the only reason for my switch to Rust, though. I want\nto walk through a couple of quick examples where I think Rust really shines in\nthe context of FreePulse.\nExamples of Rust in FreePulse\nPros\nHardware State Described By Type State\nI can't count how many times I've been bitten in development by incorrectly\ninitializing a peripheral. This can happen very easily when quickly iterating\non software or changing how the breadboard is wired during development. A\nsketched-out example in C++ (I have omitted some function definitions and\nintialization for brevity):\nenum Pin_Num {\n    PA0,\n    PA1,\n    PA2,\n};\n\nPin_Num some_gpio_pin = PA1; // This is just an enum\nconfigure_GPIO(some_gpio_pin, PULL_DOWN, OUTPUT);\n\nint analogRead(Pin_Num pn) {\n    uint8_t channel = get_adc_channel(pn);\n    ADC_RegularChannelConfig(ADC1,channel,1,ADC_SampleTime_144Cycles);\n    ADC_SoftwareStartConv(ADC1);\n    while(!ADC_GetFlagStatus(ADC1, ADC_FLAG_EOC)) { };\n    return ADC_GetConversionValue(ADC1);\n\n}\n\n// ...\n// Somewhere later on, where I forgot this pin is actually set to be OUTPUT\nanalogRead(some_gpio_pin); // RUNTIME ERROR!\n\nIn this example, some_gpio_pin is of type Pin_Num, which is simply an enum\nlisting the GPIO pins available on the hardware. When we pass in a pin to the\nanalogRead function, we know nothing about the pin other than its name; this\nis an issue because analogRead actually will not work unless the GPIO pin has\nbeen configured as an analog input. We won't discover this issue until runtime,\nwhen the call to analogRead makes our microcontroller mysteriously crash.\nHowever, if we can manage to encode the hardware state inside the type of the\npin, then we can enforce at compile time that we are passing in the correctly\nconfigured hardware. This is accomplished through the use of type state!\nType state is not a language-specific solution-- here is a minimal example of\ntype state in C++:\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\ntemplate &lt;typename MODE&gt;\nclass Pin {\n    public:\n        Pin(int num): num(num) {};\n        int get_val () { return this-&gt;num; }\n        void set_val (int val) { this-&gt;num = val; }\n    private:\n        int num;\n};\n\nstruct Output {};\nstruct Input {};\n\nvoid set_high(Pin&lt;Output&gt; pin) {\n    pin.set_val(1);\n}\n\nint read(Pin&lt;Input&gt; pin) {\n    return pin.get_val();\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n    Pin&lt;Output&gt; out_pin = Pin&lt;Output&gt;(23);\n    printf(\"%d\", read(out_pin));\n}\n\nHere, we are using a type variable MODE as a phantom type, which simply\nmeans that it only exists to \"mark\" the type of an object with some extra\ninformation. In this case, we are marking the Pin type to indicate whether it\nis an Input or Output pin. The last line of this code snippet passes in an\noutput pin to the read function, which is only valid if the pin is configured\nas an input. Since we specified the argument type of read as Pin&lt;Input&gt;, we\nnow get this helpful compiler error:\nmain.cpp: In function ‘int main(int, char**)’:\nmain.cpp:26:23: error: could not convert ‘out_pin’ from ‘Pin&lt;Output&gt;’ to ‘Pin&lt;Input&gt;’\n     printf(\"%d\", read(out_pin));\n\nAwesome! We have successfully dodged a mysterious runtime error by catching\nthis misconfiguration at compile time. However, there are still a couple of\nthings about this approach that are less than optimal. One thing that\nparticularly sticks out is that the Pin class has a set_val() method\ndefined even if the pin is configured as an input (or get_val() when\nthe pin is an output). It would be very useful if we could conditionally\nattach methods to the Pin struct.\nEnter Rust!\nuse std::marker::PhantomData;\n\nstruct Input;\nstruct Output;\n\nstruct Pin&lt;MODE&gt; {\n    _mode: PhantomData&lt;MODE&gt;,\n    num: i32,\n}\n\nimpl Pin&lt;Output&gt; {\n    fn set_high(&amp;mut self) {\n        self.num = 1;\n    }\n}\n\nimpl Pin&lt;Input&gt; {\n    fn read(&amp;self) -&gt; i32 {\n        self.num\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let in_pin = Pin::&lt;Input&gt;{num: 42, _mode: PhantomData};\n    in_pin.set_high();\n}\n\nWith Rust, we can use the impl block to attach methods to the Pin struct\nif the struct satisfies the specified type constraints. In this way, only\ninput pins have a read() method, and only output pins have a set_high()\nmethod. Sure enough, if we try to compile this code, we'll get an error on the\nlast line:\nerror[E0599]: no method named `set_high` found for type `Pin&lt;Input&gt;` in the current scope\n  --&gt; main.rs:25:13\n   |\n6  | struct Pin&lt;MODE&gt; {\n   | ---------------- method `set_high` not found for this\n...\n25 |     out_pin.set_high();\n   |             ^^^^^^^^\n\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n\nFor more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0599`.\n\nSo this is great-- we can enforce that pins will only have methods supported by\nthe configuration described in their type. But how to enforce that these type\nconstraints are valid? This is where Rust's ownership system helps us out.\nWe can define constructors for these types that take ownership of a pin,\nperforms the appropriate configuration, and returns a new pin type with the\nconfiguration parameters specified. Because of Rust's ownership system, an old\nreference to a pin that has since been re-configured can no longer be used.\nHere is a slightly modified version of the above example that demonstrates this\nfeature:\nuse std::marker::PhantomData;\n\nstruct Input;\nstruct Output;\n\nstruct Pin&lt;MODE&gt; {\n    _mode: PhantomData&lt;MODE&gt;,\n    num: i32,\n}\n\nimpl Pin&lt;Input&gt; {\n    fn read(&amp;self) -&gt; i32 {\n        self.num\n    }\n}\n\nimpl Pin&lt;Output&gt; {\n    fn set_high(&amp;mut self) {\n        self.num = 1;\n    }\n\n    fn into_input(self) -&gt; Pin&lt;Input&gt; {\n        // reconfigure pin to be an input\n        Pin::&lt;Input&gt; { num: self.num, _mode: PhantomData }\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut out_pin = Pin::&lt;Output&gt;{num: 42, _mode: PhantomData};\n    let _in_pin = out_pin.into_input();\n    out_pin.set_high();\n}\n\nThis code attempts to re-use out_pin after the hardware resource has been\nreconfigured to be an input. However, because the conversion from output to\ninput takes ownership of the pin, out_pin is now considered a \"moved value\"\nand is no longer a valid reference. The compiler helpfully reminds us of this:\nerror[E0382]: use of moved value: `out_pin`\n  --&gt; main.rs:31:5\n   |\n30 |     let _in_pin = out_pin.into_input();\n   |                   ------- value moved here\n31 |     out_pin.set_high();\n   |     ^^^^^^^ value used here after move\n   |\n   = note: move occurs because `out_pin` has type `Pin&lt;Output&gt;`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait\n\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n\nFor more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0382`.\n\nTo summarize: Rust's ability to conditionally bind methods with impl blocks\nand its ownership system work together to provide a powerful way to express\nhardware configuration via type state. I've spent a lot of time covering this\npoint because it has easily been the biggest quality-of-life improvement since\nswitching to Rust for FreePulse's development.\nSyntax Features: match, Pattern Matching, and Closures\nRust also has some really nice syntax features that make it easy to express\ncomplex logic in a safe and compiler-checked manner. For instance, here is a\nsnippet from the FreePulse SpO2 module displaying Rust's match statement and\npattern-matching:\nmatch spo2.afe4400.self_check() {\n    Ok(()) =&gt; {\n        info!(\"SpO2 passed self-check\");\n        spo2.state = Spo2State::Idle;\n    },\n    Err(AfeError::SelfCheckFail) =&gt; error!(\"Spo2 failed self-check\"),\n    Err(e) =&gt; {\n        error!(\"Communication failure during self check: {:?}.\", e);\n    }\n};\n\nCompare this to a roughly equivalent statement in C++:\nSomeResultType result = spo2.afe4400.self_check();\nif (is_ok(result)) {\n    printf(\"SpO2 passed self-check\\n\");\n    spo2.state = Spo2State.Idle;\n} else if (result.error == AfeError.SelfCheckFail) {\n    printf(\"Spo2 failed self-check\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"Communication failure during self check\\n\");\n}\n\nRust match statements are checked by the compiler for exhaustiveness, so if\nthe output of spot.afe4400.self_check() changes later on, the compiler will\nthrow an error here if there is a new possible output that is not covered in\nthe match statement. I also happen to think it just looks clean and concise!\nIn addition to match, Rust has first-class support for closures, or anonymous\nfunctions. This is not unique to Rust (C++ has lambdas, for example); however,\nit is syntactically simple and easy to use. For instance, here is a closure\nthat updates the spo2 module after acquiring a lock on the USART1 peripheral:\nlet spo2 = resources.SPO2;\nresources.USART1.lock(|usart| {\n    spo2.update(usart);\n});\n\nPackage Management System\nRust provides an excellent package management system via crates.io\nand cargo. This means that third-party dependencies are (a) enumerated and\n(b) version-locked in a controlled format. This is another huge quality-of-life\nimprovement, especially for a medical device project-- since dependencies are\nrigorously tracked as part of the project in Cargo.toml and the list is under\nversion control, it is much easier to ensure your builds are repeatable. As a\nresult of this, it is also much easier to assess risk from dependencies, known\nas \"SOUP\" (software of unknown providence) in regulatory parlance.\nActive Developer Community\nThis point cannot be overstated. Rust's developer community is active, engaged,\nand incredibly helpful to newcomers. I have benefitted tremendously from\nhanging around on the #rust-embedded IRC channel, and through the work of\njaparic and the embedded rust workgroup, driver interfaces and standards are\ngetting developed at an astonishing pace. The embedded-hal\nproject is providing a way for drivers to be interoperable with a wide variety\nof microcontrollers; the svd2rust library provides mechanisms for\ngenerating Rust hardware abstraction layers directly from the SVD specification\nof a microcontroller; and that isn't even scratching the surface of the\ndocumentation, guides, and high-level\nframeworks that are being actively developed. I have been\nworking with embedded Rust for the past two years, and the amount of progress\nmade in that time is truly incredible.\nCons\nAlthough I think that switching to Rust has been a substantial win, there are\nstill a couple of areas where the switch can make things difficult.\nWrite All Your Own Drivers\nAlthough this is changing with time, currently 99.9% of devices will not have\nany driver written in Rust. This means that if you are using a new chip, you'll\nneed to break out the datasheet and start creating the firmware. It's not all\nbad since this is also a good way to learn about the capabilities of the\nhardware you are using, but it can be tiresome if you are trying to quickly\ntest out a possible hardware candidate. It also means that your handwritten\nfirmware could possibly contain bugs!\nFor projects with a substantial number of interacting systems, this could be a\nsignificant barrier to using Rust. FreePulse has a relatively small number of\nchips besides the microcontroller that require drivers, so this wasn't enough\nof an inconvenience to outweigh the pros enumerated above.\nDevtools Experience Needs to Improve\nCompared to the tried-and-true autocomplete, go-to-definition, and other\nIDE-like capabilities that are well supported for C-family languages, Rust's\ndeveloper tooling is still maturing. Autocomplete and go-to-definition work\nsome of the time, but they struggle with macros and closures and often do not\nwork at all on generated microcontroller crates. It's not clear if there's a\ntimeline for this to be improved. I'm keeping my eye on the Rust Language\nServer project to see if tool improvements are coming down the pipeline!\nConclusion\nI think the combination of strong compiler checking, expressive type system,\nand concise, elegant syntax make Rust a satisfying language in which to write--\nand an easier language to read as well. FreePulse's migration to Rust has been\na huge learning experience, and I think the project is much better off as a\nresult of it.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/perspectives-on-rust/","title":"Perspectives on Building a Medical Device with Rust"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/project-motivation/":{"body":"I've been working on the FreePulse patient monitor for about one and a half years now. The original project idea came about\nas a result of my experiences in Rwanda in the summer of 2014; since then, it has become more refined (both\nconceptually and technically) based on feedback from doctors, nurses, and device distributors from around the world.\nAs the second version of the prototype is now in development, I think it's an opportune time to look back on the motivation\nand history of FreePulse to understand how far we've come and how far we have to go.\nThe Root of the Problem\nIn the summer of 2014, I had an incredible opportunity to work with an organization called Engineering World Health. The \nprogram they run, called the Summer Institute, trains engineering students in the maintenance and repair of medical equipment\nand then sends them to local hospitals in the developing world to work as biomedical technicians. After a month of training in\nKigali, Rwanda, I was stationed at Kabgayi District Hospital, a local hospital for the Gitarama district.\n\n_A health center in rural Rwanda_\nDuring my time at Kabgayi, I worked closely with the medical and maintenance staff and began to be integrated into the community.\nThe more the staff welcomed me into their daily lives, the more I was able to slowly understand the scope of the issues they dealt\nwith on a daily basis. Doctors routinely had to take care of patients while lacking critical devices or supplies, maintenance officers\nhad to try and fix much-needed equipment without any spare parts, and administration officials tried to procure the items that the hospital\nneeded with a minuscule budget. The staff was hard-working, intelligent, and creative; however, they constantly had to fight against the odds\nto take care of their patients. \nOne need that was particularly pressing for the hospital was a lack of patient monitors. Patient monitors are devices that keep track of \na patient's vitals signs-- their electrocardiogram (ECG), blood oxygen content (SpO2), and blood pressure (NIBP)-- and they are required\nany time a patient is put under anesthesia and recommended for every bed in the emergency ward. Most hospitals in developed countries have \na large amount of these monitors, since any patient in a questionable state of health needs to have at least one of the above vitals signs\nmonitored. However, at Kabgayi, there were only five. Five patient monitors for 404 beds. Surgeries had to be delayed, monitors had to be \ncycled between patients in the emergency ward, and sometimes monitors would have to be shifted back and forth between maternity and emergency\nvia a long, unpaved, and uncovered path.\n\n_The path from emergency to maternity at Kabgayi District Hospital_\nAfter returning back to the States, I began development on the beginnings of an idea as the design project for our university's Engineering \nWorld Health chapter: what if a patient monitor could be built at an affordable price so that hospitals could buy multiple devices from\ntheir own budget? If that could be accomplished, administrators wouldn't have to wait on donations to get new equipment, and the device \ncould actually be optimized for developing world environments. As I began fleshing out the technical details of the monitor and building\ncircuits, the idea became more of a reality, and the core elements of FreePulse were born.\nFrom Paper to Prototype\nAfter about five months of intense research, circuit design, and programming, a mock-up of the monitor was finally built with a working ECG\nand display. From the breadboard design, I was able to pull out testable data, which we then submitted to the Engineering World Health \nDesign Competition and National Institute of Health (NIH) DEBUT competition. However, the project idea wasn't finished after the design proposals\nwere submitted; I had just taken a job as a coordinator for the EWH Summer Institute, and I wanted to bring a working prototype to Rwanda with me.\nSo, working together with Abhishek Pratapa, a fellow member of TEWH, we designed a PCB and casing for the monitor, finishing the day before my flight\nto Kigali. \n\n_The first-version prototype of FreePulse_\nI'll take a moment here to recognize the members of TEWH who played integral roles in getting the project proposal submitted: in the research department,\nCourtney Koepke, Fatema Nagib, Anamika Chourisa, and Alina Schroeder all played crucial roles in collecting valuable statistics and background information\nfor the proposal; in the business department, Akash Patel drafted a business model for our proposal that explored the ability for our project to be sold \ndirectly to developing world hospitals; and in the development department, Abhishek Pratapa and Ajay Rastogi both helped to get the prototype to a testable\nstage in time for the proposal. Many of these individuals are now working on new projects focused in developing world healthcare, which you can read more\nabout at www.tewh.org. \nAnd so, I hopped onto a plane to Kigali with the first prototype of the patient monitor. During that summer, I met with doctors and device distributors in \nRwanda and began talking with them more seriously about hard numbers: what were the specifications they needed? What price points would be affordable for\nhospitals? How would the devices be distributed? After gathering this research and getting initial feedback on the form factor and user interface of the \ndevice, I began sketching out the ideas of the version two prototype of FreePulse. \nNepal That and a Bag of Chips\nFinally, amidst the number-crunching and circuit design of the second prototype, I had a unique opportunity to travel once again with EWH, this time to Nepal.\nDuring the winter of 2015, I was stationed both in Kathmandu as well as Okhaldhunga, a rural district in eastern Nepal; while I was there, I began investigating\nhow FreePulse would perform in these settings and interviewing doctors. The feedback I received from this trip helped to shape the final design of the second version\nprototype, and in the process, I was able to form connections with doctors who were excited about the idea of getting FreePulse into the field and helping to make the\nproject a reality.\nI've been extremely blessed to be able to travel as much as I have, and the fruits of that travel have been an increased network of awareness and support for FreePulse\nboth in Rwanda and Nepal. It is my hope that the finished secondary prototype can undergo field testing in one of these countries, after which a release version of the \nproduct will be developed. For news and updates on this front, you can subscribe to my blog via RSS or follow me on Twitter-- all updates will be coming through those \ntwo channels!\n\n_The maintenance office and canteen at Okhaldhunga Community Hospital_\nWhere We Are and Where We're Going\nTechnically speaking, what's FreePulse got? Right now, here's where the project stands:\n\n3-lead ECG measurement and heart rate detection\nSpO2 measurement (in development)\nsemi-automatic NIBP (in development)\n5\" color touch screen interface\nAbout 10 hours of battery life\nUninterrupted switch from wall power to battery and back\nAlarm system for heart rate and SpO2 (including piezo alarm)\n\nI'll be blogging about interesting aspects of developing FreePulse here, and if you're interested in the technical side of things, you can check out the code base. \nAll of the software for FreePulse is open-source and available in the GitHub repository. Finally, if you have any questions or simply want to know more\nabout the project, feel free to email me (address is at bottom of this page)!\nI'm excited to see the progress FreePulse is making, and I hope you are too. I want to create something that will make a positive impact and help the many medical \npersonnel whom I have met that have to struggle with a lack of medical equipment-- because when developing world healthcare is improved, we all stand to benefit.\n\n_The aunt of one of my biomedical technician colleagues in Nepal, Sun_\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/project-motivation/","title":"What's the Deal With FreePulse?"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/welcome/":{"body":"A Sizeable Transition\nMy name is Reece Stevens. I'm a biomedical engineer who loves to program, build electronics, travel, and preferably do all three\nat the same time. I've blogged before about my travel experiences (you can read about that here),\nbut this blog will be more focused on the technical projects I have been working on. In particular, I will be discussing the development\nof FreePulse, a low-cost patient monitor that was inspired by my time working in developing world hospitals in Rwanda and Nepal.\nI'm looking forward to delving into some of the more interesting and difficult aspects of building things here, including both technical\nchallenges as well as business and life challenges. This blog won't be restricted to a single project, so hopefully some of these things\nmight be useful to you too! \n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/welcome/","title":"The Start of Something New"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/":{"body":1,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/annapurna-neuro/":{"body":668,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/embedded-programming-without-ide/":{"body":1349,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/freepulse-going-to-nepal/":{"body":552,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/lessons-from-amppipal/":{"body":495,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/making-progress-at-okhaldhunga/":{"body":779,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/perspectives-on-rust/":{"body":1437,"title":5},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/project-motivation/":{"body":731,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/welcome/":{"body":73,"title":3}},"length":10},"lang":"English"};
